If the variables do not have a linear relationship with the response, or if some of the modeling assumptions are not satisfied, you may need to transform the predictors and/or the response (variable transformation) to obtain a better fit.\n",

    "1. Education, crucial for personal and societal development, equips individuals with knowledge, skills, and values needed to ‘survive’ in society. As a key driver of economic growth and social progress, education is also highly associated with an increase in earnings, lower poverty, and greater productivity. We know – education is essential! What are the complex factors that influence educational success and students' performances? The project wishes to investigate the correlation between a plethora of individual factors and educational outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. This is a **classification** problem because the result, the final grade, is not continuous. The values are integers from 0 to 20, and we will separate the grades into two groups, pass (12 or above) and fail (below) so we are categorizing students into two groups, making this a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Our grade prediction is an **inference** problem since we are most interested in identifying the factors or set of factors that have the strongest impact on the response. For this classification problem we have 2 different classes in the training set, and by identifying the strength and direction of correlations, we aim to find the relationship between attributes and the class of data in the test set. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Since we are mainly interested in seeing the relationship between the different factors and grade outcomes, we want to look at multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall, to strike a balance between all of them. ROC-AUC is a good metric to consider because we are able to specify a threshold of false positives/false negatives we are comfortable with. \n",
    "    If the intention of this project is to understand variables that are correlated with failing in order to identify students who might be struggling in class, and offer them additional help, then it might be best to minimize the false positives (students who actually failed, but are classified by the model as pass) since the school can offer additional resources to more people and the students can decide if they want it. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We will need to bin the final grades column, which currently has integer values 0-20, into two groups: pass (12 or above) and fail (below). We anticipate that there will be more failing grades than passing grades, so in order to create a more balanced training dataset, we will create a sample where half of the observations are ‘pass’ and half of the observations are ‘fail.’\n",
    "    Since our dataset has many variables, we first need to identify variables that have a statistically significant relationship with the final grade. Many variables are likely correlated, such as health status and absences. Or perhaps the father’s education is collinear with the mother’s education. Therefore, we may use wrapper methods like stepwise regression, forward selection, and backward elimination to choose the best subset of predictors. We may also use lasso and ridge regression to reduce model complexity and multicollinearity, and prevent overfitting. "
