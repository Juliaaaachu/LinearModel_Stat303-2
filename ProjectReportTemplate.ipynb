    "abstract: Using data from two Portuguese secondary schools, this project examines the connection between individual factors and educational outcomes. Focusing on inference rather than prediction, this study creates three classification models to investigate the explanatory correlation between student demographics, social and school-related characteristics, and the final year grade (G3). The findings indicate that past evaluations have a significant impact on student achievement, and that education attendance plays a significant role in determining educational success regardless of socioeconomic and demographic factors. In addition, the study suggests that policymakers and educators prioritize improving attendance rates and provide targeted support for students who are struggling. Parents can also play an important role in their children's education. The study concludes that additional research is required to identify additional strategies for enhancing academic achievement.\n",

Gains in income, decreased poverty, and increased productivity all point to it as a major factor in the expansion of the economy and the improvement of social conditions.\n",

    "In the data preparation phase, several steps were taken to transform and prepare the data for analysis. The following is a summary of the steps taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identification of categorical variables: All columns in the data frame were reviewed to identify the categorical variables. A loop comprehension was used to find the number of unique values corresponding to each column, and this information was used to decide on the data processing approach.\n",
    "- Conversion of yes-no variables to binary variables: The code created a dictionary for binary mapping and applied it to all columns in the data frame that contained 'yes' or 'no' as the response.\n",
    "- Transformation of predictors with 2 unique values: The code transformed predictors with two unique values into binary variables by mapping them to 0 or 1. This was done for variables such as \"school\", \"sex\", \"famsize\", \"address\", and \"Pstatus\".\n",
    "- Creation of new predictors: To handle variables with more than two unique values, the code created dummy variables using the \"get_dummies\" function in pandas. The dummy variables were created for the \"Mjob\", \"Fjob\", \"reason\", and \"guardian\" columns. The original columns were then dropped, and the dummy variables were concatenated with the original data frame.\n",
    "- Combination of correlated predictors: The code combined the \"Dalc\" and \"Walc\" columns into a single \"Alc\" column to reduce correlation between the two variables, and combined the \"Fedu\" and \"Medu\" columns into a single \"famEdu\" column to capture the combined education of both parents. This helped to reduce data redundancy and the noise in the data set, and removed the multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Conversion of data types: The original data frame, which consisted of both categorical and numerical values, was converted into one that only consisted of numerical data types or uint8. This made it easier and more convenient for later variable selection and model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the data cleaning and preparation phase transformed and prepared the data for analysis by converting categorical variables into binary or numerical values, combining correlated predictors, and converting the data types into a more convenient format for analysis. These steps helped to ensure the validity of the results and facilitated later variable selection and model development."

    "During Data Exploration, we realized it will remain difficult for us to  predicting a score from 0-20 using predictor variables that are (mostly) binary in value. This can be problematic because binary variables typically have a non-linear relationship with the outcome variable, and it can be difficult to predict a continuous score with such data. Moreover, using all categorical close-to-binary data for a prediction problem from a scale of 0-20 is a bad idea because it can result in inaccurate predictions and may not capture the nuances of the data.

    "- K-Fold cross-validation and train-test split: K-Fold cross-validation and train-test split were used to assess the model's accuracy. In K-Fold cross-validation, the data was divided into K equal parts, and the model was trained and tested K times, with each part being used as the test set once. In the train-test split, the data was divided into a training set and a validation set, and the model was trained on the training set and tested on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree search: A decision tree was built for numerical feature selection. We used `DecisionTreeRegressor` as opposed to `DecisionTreeClassifier` as we were treating the problem as a prediction problem on the first hand, followed by manual classification based on the pass/fail threshold. Variables `failures` and `absences` were identified as the two most important features.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Chi-square test variable selection: The chi-square test was used to select the most important categorical predictors by assessing the dependence between the categorical predictors and the target variable. `schoolsup` (extra educational support( and parents' job (mother's job `Mjob` and father's job `Fjob`) were important as relatively important predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the limitations of a non-linear regressor (`DecisionTreeRegressor`) in identifying important features for linear regression, more than one decision tree was built to analyze and identify the important features. While the selected features often vary,  the most important factors kept at each tree's top branch - features consistently selected as the most important ones regardless of trees built - were `failures` and `absences`. With this information, the base model was developed using only these 2 most important features, along with their interaction terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$G3 \\sim absences$$\n",
    "$$G3 \\sim failures$$\n",
    "$$G3 \\sim absences * failures$$\n",

    "Three models was fitted using these three predictors (`failures`, `absences`, `failures * absences`), and a 100% accuracy was achieved on the training and testing data. Accuracy was used as the only metric at this stage, as it provides a direct measure of the model's basic performance without giving weight to the cost of different errors. Later, more refined metrics will be used to weigh the priorities and relative costs of different types of errors."

In addition, the study was done in Portugal, which may limit its applicability to other nations or areas.Â \n",
